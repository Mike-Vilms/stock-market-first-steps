### Summary
- Overall - weak position, well-matured European company, "blue chip" of its industry, not so much growth potential.
  - Could be wrong, assesment is based on the picture of US commumication industry, I assume European market has similar outlook.
- Last 5 years of earnings in M$: 90$; -3,882$;	-723$;	236$;	2,090$;	
- Current market cap: 40B$ - over-priced based on current fundamentals
- Debt - just fine, no signs of over-laverage
- Dividends - totaly fine, company can afford ones based on historical cash-flow
- Number of shares outstanding - no changes for >10 years (??? - very unusual...)

### Note #I - 2017 Disruption: Dividend Cut
- Obviously they cut dividends in 2017 - and they cut it dramatically - which is a positive thing for current opportunity but is another sign of "mature" company

### Note #II - 2017 Disruption: No Idea what the hell is going on:
- Some completely crazy blend of transactions was going on in 2017 - majority of them are under "other" gain/expense line. I have no idea how to evaluate this stuff...
