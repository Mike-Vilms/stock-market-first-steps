## II. Balance Sheet
### 2.1 Current Assets
- Assets are resources controlled by a company for the purpose of generating profit. 
- They can be categorized into two groups—current and noncurrent. 
  - Current assets are resources readily convertible to cash within the operating cycle of the company. Major classes of current assets include cash, cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, and prepaid expenses.
  - Long-term (or noncurrent) assets are resources expected to benefit the company for periods beyond the current period. Major long-term assets include
property, plant, equipment, intangibles, investments, and deferred charges.
- **Current assets** include cash and other assets that are convertible to cash, usually within the **operating cycle** of the company.
- **Operating cycle** is the amount of time from commitment of cash for purchases until the collection of cash resulting from sales of goods or services. It is the process by which a company converts cash into short-term assets and back into cash as part of its ongoing operating activities.

- For a manufacturing company, this would entail purchasing raw materials, converting them to finished goods, and then selling and collecting cash from receivables.
- **Cash represents the starting point, and the end point, of the operating cycle**. The operating cycle is used to classify assets (and liabilities) as either current or noncurrent. **Current assets** are expected to be sold, collected, or used within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. 
- Typical examples are: 
  - cash, 
  - cash equivalents, 
  - short-term receivables,
  - short-term securities, 
  - inventories, 
  - and prepaid expenses.
- The excess of current assets over current liabilities is called **working capital**
- **Working capital is a double-edged sword—companies need working capital to effectively operate, yet working capital is costly because it must be financed and can entail other operating costs, such as credit losses on accounts receivable and storage and logistics costs for inventories. Many companies attempt to improve profitability and cash flow by reducing investment in current assets through methods such as effective credit underwriting and collection of receivables, and just-in-time inventory management. In addition, companies try to finance a large portion of their current assets through current liabilities, such as accounts payable and accruals, in an attempt to reduce working capital.**

#### 2.1.1 Cash And Cash Equivalents
- **Cash**, the most liquid asset, includes currency available and funds on deposit
- **Cash equivalents** are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and so near maturity that they have minimal risk of price changes due to interest rate movements. These investments usually carry maturities of three months or less. **Examples of cash equivalents are short-term treasury bills, commercial paper, and money market funds**. Cash equivalents often serve as temporary repositories of excess cash.
- The concept of **liquidity** is important in financial statement analysis. By liquidity, we mean the amount of cash or cash equivalents the company has on hand and the amount of cash it can raise in a short period of time. Liquidity provides flexibility to take advantage of changing market conditions and to react to strategic actions by competitors.
- Liquidity also relates to the ability of a company to meet its obligations as they mature. Many companies with strong balance sheets (where there exists substantial equity capital in relation to total assets) can still run into serious difficulties because of illiquidity.
- In general, companies in a dynamic industry require increased liquidity to take advantage of opportunities or to react to a quickly changing competitive landscape.
- **To the extent that cash equivalents are invested in equity securities, companies risk a reduction in liquidity should the market value of those investments decline.**

#### 2.1.2 Accounts Receivable
- **Receivables** are amounts due to the company that arise from the sale of products or services, or from advances (loaning of money) to other companies.
- **Accounts receivable** refer to amounts due to the company that arise from sales of products and services.
- **Notes receivable** refer to formal written promises of indebtedness due.
- **```Valuation of Receivables;``` Experience shows that companies do not collect all receivables. While decisions about collectibility can be made at any time, collectibility of receivables as a group is best estimated on the basis of past experience, with suitable allowance for current economy, industry, and debtor conditions. The risk in this analysis is that past experience might not be an adequate predictor of future loss, or that we fail to fully account for current conditions.**
- In practice, companies report receivables at their net realizable **value—total** amount of receivables less an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Management estimates the allowance for uncollectibles based on experience, customer fortunes, economy and industry expectations, and collection policies. **Uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance (often reported as a deduction from receivables in the balance sheet), and the expected loss is included in current operating expenses**.
- ```Collection Risk;``` Full information to assess collection risk for receivables is not usually included in financial statements. Analysis tools for investigating collectibility include:
  - Comparing competitors’ receivables as a percentage of sales with those of the company under analysis.
  - Examining customer concentration—risk increases when receivables are concentrated in one or a few customers.
  - Computing and investigating trends in the average collection period of receivables compared with customary credit terms for the industry.
  - Determining the portion of receivables that are renewals of prior accounts or notes receivable.
- ```Authenticity of Receivables;``` The description of receivables in financial statements or notes is usually insufficient to provide reliable clues as to whether receivables are genuine, due, and enforceable. Knowledge of industry practices and supplementary sources of information are used for added assurance.
  - One factor affecting authenticity is the right of merchandise return. Customers in certain industries, like the magazine, textbook, or toy industries, enjoy a substantial right of merchandise return. Our analysis must allow for return privileges. Liberal return privileges can impair quality of receivables.
- ```Securitization of Receivables;``` 
  - Another important analysis issue arises when a company sells all or a portion of its receivables to a third party which, typically, finances the sale by selling bonds to the capital markets. The collection of those receivables provides the source for the yield on the bond. **Such practice is called securitization**.
  - **The sale of receivables to a bank or commercial finance company is called factoring.**
  - Receivables can be kept off the balance sheet only when the company selling its receivables surrenders all control over the receivables to an independent buyer of sufficient financial strength. This means as long as a buyer has any type of recourse or the selling company has any degree of retained interest in the receivables, the company selling receivables has to continue to record both an asset and a compensating liability for the amount sold.
  - The securitization of receivables is often accomplished by establishing a special purpose entity (SPE) to purchase the receivables from the company and finance the purchase via sale of bonds into the market.

#### 2.1.3 Prepaid Expenses
- **Prepaid expenses** are advance payments for services or goods not yet received.
- Examples are advance payments for rent, insurance, utilities, and property taxes.
- Prepaid expenses usually are classified in current assets because they reflect services due that would otherwise require use of current assets.

#### 2.1.4 Inventory
- **Inventories** are goods held for sale as part of a company’s normal business operations. With the exception of certain service organizations, inventories are essential and important assets of companies.
- The **inventory equation** is useful in understanding inventory flows. For a merchandising company:
  - **Beginning inventories + Net purchases - Cost of goods sold = Ending inventories**

#### ```Flow of Costs```
- The costs of inventories are initially recorded on the balance sheet.
- As the inventories are sold, these costs are removed from the balance sheet and flow into the income statement as cost of goods sold (COGS).
- Costs cannot be in two places at the same time; either they remain on the balance sheet (as a future expense) or are recognized currently in the income statement and reduce profitability to match against sales revenue.
-  If all inventories acquired or manufactured during the period are sold, then COGS is equal to the cost of the goods purchased or manufactured. When inventories remain at the end of the accounting period, however, it is important to determine which inventories have been sold and which costs remain on the balance sheet.
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85560091/123995881-5e92d380-d994-11eb-9779-6e326c023e9d.png)
- There are **three GAAP options** in determining how to calculate COGS against sales; Let's consider next scenario:
```
Inventory on January 1, Year 2 40 units @ $500 each $20,000
Inventories purchased during the year 60 units @ $600 each 36,000
Cost of goods available for sale 100 units $56,000
```
- **"First-In, First-Out"**: This method assumes that the first units purchased are the first units sold;
```
Sales $24,000
COGS (30 @ $500 each) 15,000
Gross profit $ 9,000
```
- **"Last-In, First-Out"**: Under the LIFO inventory costing assumption, the last units purchased are the first to be sold; LIFO is not allowed under IFRS as a method for valuing inventories.
```
Sales $24,000
COGS (30 @ $500 each) 15,000
Gross profit $ 9,000
```
- **"Average Cost"**: COGS is computed as a weighted average of the total cost of goods available for sale divided by the number of units available for sale;
```
Sales $24,000
COGS (30 @ $560 each) 16,800
Gross profit $ 7,200
```
- The income statements under the three methods, then, are as follows:

Method | Sales | COGS | Gross Profit 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
FIFO | $24,000 | $15,000 | $9,000
LIFO | 24,000 | 18,000 | 6,000
Average cost |24,000 | 16,800 | 7,200

- **As the examples presented here highlight, gross profit can be affected by the company’s choice of its inventory costing method. In periods of rising prices, FIFO produces higher gross profits than LIFO because lower cost inventories are matched against sales revenues at current market prices. This is sometimes referred to as FIFO’s phantom profits as the gross profit is actually a sum of two components: an economic profit and a holding gain.**
  - The economic profit is equal to the number of units sold multiplied by the difference between the sales price and the replacement cost of the inventories
  - The holding gain is the increase in replacement cost since the inventories were acquired and is equal to the number of units sold multiplied by the difference between the current replacement cost and the original acquisition cost:

### 2.2 Long-Term Assets
- Long-term assets are resources that are used to generate operating revenues (or reduce operating costs) for more than one period.
  - The most common type of long-term asset is tangible fixed assets such as property, plant, and equipment. 
  - Long-term assets also include intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill.
