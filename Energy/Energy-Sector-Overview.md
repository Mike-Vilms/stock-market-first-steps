### Upstream
- Aslo known as Exploration and Production(E&P) segment

#### Upstream Overview
- E&P activities:
  - Searching
  - Recovering
  - Producing crude oil and natural gas
- Upstream is all about **wells**:
  - Where to locate them?
  - How deep and how far to drill them?
  - How to design, construct, operate and manage them?
- Upstream business characteristics:
  - High Risk - High Reward
  - Highly Regulated
  - Impact by Global Polictics
  - Technology Intensive 
- Types of activities:
  - **Exploration**:
    -  Obtaining a lease from the owner of onshore or ofshore acreage thought to contain oil or gas
    -  Conducting geological and geophysical surveys to determine the first well site for "wildcat drilling" 
  - **Drilling**: creating a borehole in the ground that will eventually become an oil or gas well; This operations might be executed by contractors and service companies in the "Oilfield Services" business sector
  - **Production**: bringing hydrocarbons to the surface and treating them as needed to make them marketable
- **Unconventional Upstream**: defined as any resource that is extracted/produced by any method other than the traditional vertical or slightly deviated well
  - Horisontal Drilling
  - Hydraulic Fracturing, or Fracking
  - Subsea Engineering (Deepwater Drilling)
#### Upstream Players
- **Majors**: also called as "Integrated Oil Companies" operate assets in other segments of the industry
  - Exxon
  - Chevron
  - BP
  - Shell 
- **NOCs**: National Oil Companies that are owned and managed by governments around the world
  - Saudi Aramco
  - Pemex
- **Independents**: companies that are not integrated into other segments of industry; These are the companies that concentrate solely on finding and producing oil and gas
  - Apache
  - Anadarko
- **Oilfield Services**: Companies that provide specialized equipment, services and technichal skills needed for exploring, drilling and completing, testing, producing and maintaining crude oil and natural gas; They typically do not produce oil and gas or own assets that contain hydrocarbon reserves
