  - Searching
  - Recovering
  - Producing crude oil and natural gas
- Upstream is all about **wells**:
  - Where to locate them?
  - How deep and how far to drill them?
  - How to design, construct, operate and manage them?
- Types of activities:
  - **Exploration**:
    -  Obtaining a lease from the owner of onshore or ofshore acreage thought to contain oil or gas
    -  Conducting geological and geophysical surveys to determine the first well site for "wildcat drilling" 
  - **Drilling**: creating a borehole in the ground that will eventually become an oil or gas well; This operations might be executed by contractors and service companies in the "Oilfield Services" business sector
  - **Production**: bringing hydrocarbons to the surface and treating them as needed to make them marketable
- **Unconventional Upstream**: defined as any resource that is extracted/produced by any method other than the traditional vertical or slightly deviated well
  - Horisontal Drilling
  - Hydraulic Fracturing, or Fracking
  - Subsea Engineering (Deepwater Drilling)
- **Classification of Wells**:
  - Deviated Wells
