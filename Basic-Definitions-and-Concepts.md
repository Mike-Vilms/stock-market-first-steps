## Enterprise Value
- Enterprise Value (EV) is the measure of a company’s total value. It looks at the entire market value rather than just the equity value, so all ownership interests and asset claims from both debt and equity are included. EV can be thought of as the effective cost of buying a company or the theoretical price of a target company (before a takeover premium is considered).
- **EV = MC + Total Debt − C**
  - *MC = Market capitalization; equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares*
  - *Total debt = Equal to the sum of short-term and long-term debt*
  - *C = Cash and cash equivalents; the liquid assets of a company, but may not include marketable securities*
- **EV = Common Shares + Preferred Shares + Market Value of Debt + Minority Interest – Cash and Equivalents**
- Enterprise value (EV) could be thought of like the theoretical takeover price if a company were to be bought.
- The value of a firm's debt, for example, would need to be paid off by the buyer when taking over a company. As a result, enterprise value provides a much more accurate takeover valuation because it includes debt in its value calculation.

## Free Cash Flow
- Free cash flow (FCF) measures a company’s financial performance. It shows the cash that a company can produce after deducting the purchase of assets such as property, equipment, and other major investments from its operating cash flow. In other words, FCF measures a company’s ability to produce what investors care most about: cash that’s available to be distributed in a discretionary way.
- Formula: **Free Cash Flow = Cash Flow from Operations - Purchase of PP&E**
- Knowing the company’s free cash flow enables management to decide on future ventures that would improve the shareholder value. Additionally, having an abundant FCF indicates that a company is capable of paying its monthly dues. Companies can also use their FCF to expand business operations or pursue other short-term investments.
- Meanwhile, other entities looking to invest may likely consider companies that have a healthy free cash flow because of a promising future. Couple this with a low-valued share price, investors can generally make good investments with companies that have high FCF. Other investors greatly consider FCF compared to other measures because it also serves as an important basis for stock pricing.
- The company’s net income greatly affects a company’s free cash flow because it also influences a company’s ability to generate cash from operations. As such, other activities (i.e., those not within the core business operations of a company) from which the company generates income must be scrutinized deeply in order to reflect a more appropriate FCF value.
- On the investors’ side, they must be wary of a company’s policies that affect their declaration of FCF. For example, some companies lengthen the time to settle their debts to maintain cash or, the opposite, shortening the time they collect debts due to them. Companies also have different guidelines on which assets they declare as capital expenditures, thus affecting the computation of FCF.

## Net Present Value
- Net Present Value (NPV) is the value of all future cash flows (positive and negative) over the entire life of an investment discounted to the present. NPV analysis is a form of intrinsic valuation and is used extensively across finance and accounting for determining the value of a business, investment security, capital project, new venture, cost reduction program, and anything that involves cash flow.
