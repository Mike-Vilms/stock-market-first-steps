## Industry Overview
Tobacco categories:
- **Combustible cigarettes**
  - Raw material - tobacco leaf 
- **Vapour Products**: Handheld, battery-powered devices that heat a liquid (called an e-liquid, usually containing nicotine) and creates a vapour to be inhaled.
- **Tobacco Heating Products (THP)**: THPs do not burn tobacco, so no smoke (which is a key source of toxicants) is produced. Research indicates that by heating tobacco rather than burning it, THPs have the potential to be reduced-risk compared to smoking.
- **Modern oral nicotine pouches**: This is our most recent innovation across oral products offering consumers a satisfying experience with a range of different flavours. Two formulations are available: one containing lower levels of tobacco, and one that contains nicotine but no tobacco.
- **Traditional Oral**: Traditional Oral products do contain tobacco, but there is no burning. There is strong epidemiological evidence, from countries such as Sweden, that switching completely to snus can reduce risk compared to smoking.

### Global combustible market
Sales for the legal global tobacco market (2019) were worth approximately US$818 billion, according to the most recent estimates. The largest global tobacco category remains combustible cigarettes. With over 5,200 billion cigarettes consumed annually, it is valued at US$705 billion. Over 19% of the world’s adult population still chooses to smoke and will likely continue to do so unless consumers are offered suitable alternatives. However, cigarette volumes have been falling. This is largely due to increased regulation and changing societal attitudes. One reason for the decline of legal tobacco volumes is the continued rise in illicit product consumption. This is now estimated to account for 12% of the global tobacco market. A number of factors are driving the significant and growing illicit cigarette trade. These include the fact that cigarettes remain a reliable source of tax revenue for governments worldwide, price differentials between markets, regulatory changes and broader macroeconomic pressures. It is generally accepted that there is a direct correlation between steep, ad hoc increases in taxes and illicit sales. The current sanctions in many countries of often fail to deter criminals in search of profit.
### Global combustible regulation
As one of the world’s most regulated and taxed industries, tobacco contributes over US$200 billion to government treasuries annually. Manufacturers are required to comply with a variety of regulations, varying considerably from market to market. Legislation and regulation has focused mainly on: the introduction of plain packaging, product-specific regulations, graphic health warnings on packs, tougher restrictions on smoking in enclosed public places and bans on shops displaying tobacco products at the point of sale. More recently, governments have begun considering and adopting regulations aimed at menthol flavourings. They have also targeted environmental concerns resulting from litter associated with cigarette consumption.
### Global New Categories market 
In recent years, the global tobacco and nicotine market has diversified beyond traditional, combustible tobacco. Evidence can be seen in growing categories like Vapour Products, Tobacco Heating Products (THP) and modern oral nicotine pouches. The success of these New Categories is based on many factors. One is their ability to offer consumers satisfaction, in circumstances where combustible tobacco is no longer permitted or socially acceptable. Another is their ability to offer reduced risk compared to combustible products.*† New generations of adult consumers are focusing on health and lifestyle considerations, technological innovation, and personalised experiences. As a result, we expect the growth of New Categories to keep accelerating, as these products better meet those preferences and demands. 

The latest global figures (2019) suggest that global vapour sales are worth US$20.2 billion, while global THP revenues stand at US$15.2 billion. This is an increase of US$4.5 billion and US$3.3 billion, respectively, on 2018. Traditional oral products show steady, incremental growth. Meanwhile, new modern oral products are showing accelerated volume expansion in both Europe and the US. The relatively nascent market for wellbeing and ‘new active’ products has also grown. This is expected to continue as consumer tastes fragment and evolve. Within this space, cannabidiol (CBD) is expected to gain wider use, as evidenced by its recent growth in market size.
