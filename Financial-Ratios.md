## 2. Profitability Ratios
- Profitability ratios are financial metrics used by analysts and investors to measure and evaluate the ability of a company to generate income (profit) relative to revenue, balance sheet assets, operating costs, and shareholders’ equity during a specific period of time. They show how well a company utilizes its assets to produce profit and value to shareholders.
- A higher ratio or value is commonly sought-after by most companies, as this usually means the business is performing well by generating revenues, profits, and cash flow. The ratios are most useful when they are analyzed in comparison to similar companies or compared to previous periods. The most commonly used profitability ratios are examined below.
- There are various profitability ratios that are used by companies to provide useful insights into the financial well-being and performance of the business. All of these ratios can be generalized into two categories, as follows:
  - **Margin Ratios**: Margin ratios represent the company’s ability to convert sales into profits at various degrees of measurement. Examples are gross profit margin, operating profit margin, net profit margin, cash flow margin, EBIT, EBITDA, EBITDAR, NOPAT, operating expense ratio, and overhead ratio.
  - **Return Ratios**: Return ratios represent the company’s ability to generate returns to its shareholders. Examples include return on assets, return on equity, cash return on assets, return on debt, return on retained earnings, return on revenue, risk-adjusted return, return on invested capital, and return on capital employed.

### 2.1 Gross Profit Margin
- Formula: **Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Sales**

### 2.2 Operating Profit Margin
- Formula: **Operating Profit Margin = EBIT / Sales**
- *Operating profit* is what's left to pay for interest to lenders, taxes to government and dividends (or other form of return of capital to shareholders)

### 2.3 Net Profit Margin
- Formula: **Net Profit Margin = Net income / Sales**
- You may be asking yourself, “what is a good profit margin?” A good margin will vary considerably by industry, but as a general rule of thumb, a 10% net profit margin is considered average, a 20% margin is considered high (or “good”), and a 5% margin is low. Again, these guidelines vary widely by industry and company size, and can be impacted by a variety of other factors.

### Return on Assets
- Return on Assets (ROA) is a metric that measures the profitability of a business in relation to its total assets. This ratio indicates how well a company is performing by comparing the profit (net income) it’s generating to the capital it’s invested in assets.  The higher the return, the more productive and efficient management is in utilizing economic resources.
- Formula: 
  - **ROA = Net Income / Average Assets** or
  - **ROA = Net Income / End of Period Assets**
- Below are some examples of the most common reasons companies perform an analysis of their return on assets:
  - **Using ROA to determine profitability and efficiency**: Return on assets indicates the amount of money earned per dollar of assets. Therefore, a higher return on assets value indicates that a business is more profitable and efficient.
  - **Using ROA to compare performance between companies**: It is important to note that return on assets should not be compared across industries. Companies in different industries vary significantly in their use of assets. For example, some industries may require expensive property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to generate income as opposed to companies in other industries. Therefore, these companies would naturally report a lower return on assets when compared to companies that do not require a lot of assets to operate. Therefore, return on assets should only be used to compare with companies within an industry. Learn more about industry analysis.
  - **Using ROA to determine asset-intensive/asset-light companies**: Return on assets can be used to gauge how asset-intensive a company is:
    - The lower the return on assets, the more asset-intensive a company is. An example of an asset-intensive company would be an airline company.
    - The higher the return on assets, the less asset-intensive a company is. An example of an asset-light company would be a software company.
    - As a general rule, a return on assets under 5% is considered an asset-intensive business while a return on assets above 20% is considered an asset-light business.
