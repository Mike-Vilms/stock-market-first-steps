## 1. Liquidity Ratios
- https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/liquidity-ratio/
- A liquidity ratio is a type of financial ratio used to determine a company’s ability to pay its short-term debt obligations. The metric helps determine if a company can use its current, or liquid, assets to cover its current liabilities.
- Three liquidity ratios are commonly used – the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio. In each of the liquidity ratios, the current liabilities amount is placed in the denominator of the equation, and the liquid assets amount is placed in the numerator.
- Given the structure of the ratio, with assets on top and liabilities on the bottom, ratios above 1.0 are sought after. A ratio of 1 means that a company can exactly pay off all its current liabilities with its current assets. A ratio of less than 1 (e.g., 0.75) would imply that a company is not able to satisfy its current liabilities.
- A ratio greater than 1 (e.g., 2.0) would imply that a company is able to satisfy its current bills. In fact, a ratio of 2.0 means that a company can cover its current liabilities two times over. A ratio of 3.0 would mean they could cover their current liabilities three times over, and so forth.
- Liquidity ratios are important to investors and creditors to determine if a company can cover their short-term obligations, and to what degree. A ratio of 1 is better than a ratio of less than 1, but it isn’t ideal.
- Creditors and investors like to see higher liquidity ratios, such as 2 or 3. The higher the ratio is, the more likely a company is able to pay its short-term bills. A ratio of less than 1 means the company faces a negative working capital and can be experiencing a liquidity crisis.
- Creditors analyze liquidity ratios when deciding whether or not they should extend credit to a company. They want to be sure that the company they lend to has the ability to pay them back. Any hint of financial instability may disqualify a company from obtaining loans.
- **Low liquidity ratios raise a red flag, but “the higher, the better” is only true to a certain extent. At some point, investors will question why a company’s liquidity ratios are so high. Yes, a company with a liquidity ratio of 8.5 will be able to confidently pay its short-term bills, but investors may deem such a ratio excessive. An abnormally high ratio means the company holds a large amount of liquid assets.**
- **For example, if a company’s cash ratio was 8.5, investors and analysts may consider that too high. The company holds too much cash on hand, which isn’t earning anything more than the interest the bank offers to hold their cash. It can be argued that the company should allocate the cash amount towards other initiatives and investments that can achieve a higher return.**

### 1.1 Current Ratio
- **Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities**
- A liquidity ratio is a type of financial ratio used to determine a company’s ability to pay its short-term debt obligations. The metric helps determine if a company can use its current, or liquid, assets to cover its current liabilities.
- Three liquidity ratios are commonly used – the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio. In each of the liquidity ratios, the current liabilities amount is placed in the denominator of the equation, and the liquid assets amount is placed in the numerator.
- Given the structure of the ratio, with assets on top and liabilities on the bottom, ratios above 1.0 are sought after. A ratio of 1 means that a company can exactly pay off all its current liabilities with its current assets. A ratio of less than 1 (e.g., 0.75) would imply that a company is not able to satisfy its current liabilities.

### 1.2 Quick Ratio
- **Quick Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivables + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities**
- **Quick Ratio == Acid Test Ratio**
- The quick ratio is a stricter test of liquidity than the current ratio. Both are similar in the sense that current assets is the numerator, and current liabilities is the denominator.
- However, the quick ratio only considers certain current assets. It considers more liquid assets such as cash, accounts receivables, and marketable securities. It leaves out current assets such as inventory and prepaid expenses because the two are less liquid. So, the quick ratio is more of a true test of a company’s ability to cover its short-term obligations.

### 1.3 Cash Ratio
- **Cash Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities**
- The cash ratio takes the test of liquidity even further. This ratio only considers a company’s most liquid assets – cash and marketable securities. They are the assets that are most readily available to a company to pay short-term obligations.
- In terms of how strict the tests of liquidity are, you can view the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio as easy, medium, and hard.

## 2. Leverage Financial Ratios
- https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/leverage-ratios/
- A leverage ratio is any kind of financial ratio that indicates the level of debt incurred by a business entity against several other accounts in its balance sheet, income statement, or cash flow statement.  These ratios provide an indication of how the company’s assets and business operations are financed (using debt or equity). Below is an illustration of two common leverage ratios: debt/equity and debt/capital.

### 2.1 Debt-to-Assets Ratio
- Formula: **Total Debt / Total Assets**
### 2.2 Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- Formula: **Total Debt / Total Equity**
### 2.3 Debt-to-Capital Ratio
- Formula: **Today Debt / (Total Debt + Total Equity)**
### 2.4 Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio
- Formula: **Total Debt / Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation & Amortization**
### 2.5 Asset-to-Equity Ratio
- Formula: **Total Assets / Total Equity**

## 2. Profitability Ratios
- Profitability ratios are financial metrics used by analysts and investors to measure and evaluate the ability of a company to generate income (profit) relative to revenue, balance sheet assets, operating costs, and shareholders’ equity during a specific period of time. They show how well a company utilizes its assets to produce profit and value to shareholders.
- A higher ratio or value is commonly sought-after by most companies, as this usually means the business is performing well by generating revenues, profits, and cash flow. The ratios are most useful when they are analyzed in comparison to similar companies or compared to previous periods. The most commonly used profitability ratios are examined below.
- There are various profitability ratios that are used by companies to provide useful insights into the financial well-being and performance of the business. All of these ratios can be generalized into two categories, as follows:
  - **Margin Ratios**: Margin ratios represent the company’s ability to convert sales into profits at various degrees of measurement. Examples are gross profit margin, operating profit margin, net profit margin, cash flow margin, EBIT, EBITDA, EBITDAR, NOPAT, operating expense ratio, and overhead ratio.
  - **Return Ratios**: Return ratios represent the company’s ability to generate returns to its shareholders. Examples include return on assets, return on equity, cash return on assets, return on debt, return on retained earnings, return on revenue, risk-adjusted return, return on invested capital, and return on capital employed.

### 2.1 Gross Profit Margin
- Formula: **Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Sales**

### 2.2 Operating Profit Margin
- Formula: **Operating Profit Margin = EBIT / Sales**
- *Operating profit* is what's left to pay for interest to lenders, taxes to government and dividends (or other form of return of capital to shareholders)

### 2.3 Net Profit Margin
- Formula: **Net Profit Margin = Net income / Sales**
- You may be asking yourself, “what is a good profit margin?” A good margin will vary considerably by industry, but as a general rule of thumb, a 10% net profit margin is considered average, a 20% margin is considered high (or “good”), and a 5% margin is low. Again, these guidelines vary widely by industry and company size, and can be impacted by a variety of other factors.

### Return on Assets
- Return on Assets (ROA) is a metric that measures the profitability of a business in relation to its total assets. This ratio indicates how well a company is performing by comparing the profit (net income) it’s generating to the capital it’s invested in assets.  The higher the return, the more productive and efficient management is in utilizing economic resources.
- Formula: 
  - **ROA = Net Income / Average Assets** or
  - **ROA = Net Income / End of Period Assets**
- Below are some examples of the most common reasons companies perform an analysis of their return on assets:
  - **Using ROA to determine profitability and efficiency**: Return on assets indicates the amount of money earned per dollar of assets. Therefore, a higher return on assets value indicates that a business is more profitable and efficient.
  - **Using ROA to compare performance between companies**: It is important to note that return on assets should not be compared across industries. Companies in different industries vary significantly in their use of assets. For example, some industries may require expensive property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to generate income as opposed to companies in other industries. Therefore, these companies would naturally report a lower return on assets when compared to companies that do not require a lot of assets to operate. Therefore, return on assets should only be used to compare with companies within an industry. Learn more about industry analysis.
  - **Using ROA to determine asset-intensive/asset-light companies**: Return on assets can be used to gauge how asset-intensive a company is:
    - The lower the return on assets, the more asset-intensive a company is. An example of an asset-intensive company would be an airline company.
    - The higher the return on assets, the less asset-intensive a company is. An example of an asset-light company would be a software company.
    - As a general rule, a return on assets under 5% is considered an asset-intensive business while a return on assets above 20% is considered an asset-light business.
